title: "Report for General Evaluation of Assemblies"
intro_text: "MultiQC reports summarise analysis results."
subtitle: "This repo contains the snakemake pipeline to evaluate de novo assemblies using short-reads. As input, the pipeline takes a one or more assemblies in fasta format and a paired-end short reads in fastq format and run 3 tools that estimate assembly metrics. The pipeline is useful when we wish to estimate which assembly is best among a set of genome assemblies produced by different assembler tools.
</br>The executed tools are:</br>
    1. REAPR
    2. ALE
    3. BUSCO"
